# Intro-to-Python-Assignment


## Description

### Objective

Practice creating Python programs to perform arithmetic and string operations, experimenting with variables, and exploring data types.

### Instructions

#### Basic Calculator Program

Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).  
Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.  

Example:  
If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display:  
10 + 5 = 15

## What This Project Contains

- calculator.py: A simple Python script using basic input, arithmetic, and print statements.
- README.md: This file explains how to use the program and includes the assignment instructions.

## How to Run the Program

1. Open IDLE or any Python code editor.
2. Open or paste the code from calculator.py.
3. Run the script.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Sample Output

Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter +, -, *, or /: +
